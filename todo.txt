Questions:

Why does the receiver need sws and mtu?

Do we only get one chance at handshake? If not, what's the timout? ==> Currently assuming no!

What units is time in for the print statements in send and rec()?

What happens if number of retrans limit is hit for closing do we still close sockets? ===> Currently assuming yes!


TODOs:

Change TCPend so that usage is printed when BOTH !=12 AND != 8 are true     (DONE)
Add toString methods to help debug                                          (DONE)

Write checksum method                                                       (DONE)
Write serialize and deserialize methods                                     (DONE)
Add unit tests for serialize and deserialize b/c they are important         (PARTIAL)

Add and init additional data structures to maintain:                        (NEEDS REVIEW)
    Num of retransmits  
    Timeout
    window
    All possible packets

Add init functions to                                                       (NEEDS REVIEW)
    Above inits
    Creat all possible packets

Write timeout calculation method                                            (NEEDS REVIEW)

Don't forget to add the summary print statements

Write code to send packet                                                   (DONE)
    Test by sending data one-way with no response expectations

Write code to establish connection                                          (DONE)
    Sender will have an establish method
    Receiver must first open passive connection
    Receiver will likely have a generic "listen" thereafter

Write code to receive packet                                                (DONE)

Write code to terminate connection                                          (DONE)

Update receive and send code to handle sliding window

Will likely need to modify Makefile so that it isn't looking at src folder
